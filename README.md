# Analysis of data Kickstarting campaign 

## Overview of project
Louise has been trying to identify trends that will help her implement better practices to determine her targets in a more reliable way. This project presents diverse data related to different crowdfunding campaigns organized by her from 2014 to 2017.  Therefore, through this analysis, Louise will be able to find out any hidden trends. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visualize the campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals. This part of the project will only base our analysis on two categories: Theater and Plays. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes based on Launched date
For the purpose of this analysis, we took into consideration the Parent Category "Theater." To make this evaluation, we considered the number of outcomes (Successful, Failed, Canceled) based on the launched date per month for the campaign (2014 – 2017). 
With the data shown in Chart 1 (see below), Louise will be able to identify the following:
- During May, June, and July, there is a tendency to have many successful events based on her launched dates. The data for these three months also shows that there is a slightly linear behavior of numbers of failed events, which means that the targets established for these three months were coherent.
- The number of successful vs. failed events follows a similar tendency between the months of January to April, and September to November. That means that Louise needs to revaluate her targets for both outcomes. Overall, in order to increase the number of successful events and reduce the number of failed events, she needs to reduce the target goals for the months aforementioned. 
- Another critical point to highlight is that the number of successful and failed events is significantly similar during December, which means that the successful events' goals should be re-assessed for future events during this month.
- Lately, the number of canceled events is insignificant given the population's size shown in the data set and represents a linear behavior along the year. One point to consider is that in October, no events were canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals
For the purpose of this analysis, we took into consideration the Parent Category "Theater" and subcategory "Plays." To make this evaluation, we considered the number of outcomes (Successful, Failed, Canceled) on a different dollar-amount range, which allowed us to organize the events on their specific goal amount for the campaign (2014 – 2017). 
With the data shown in Chart 2 (see below), Louise will be able to identify the following:
-	The percentage of successful events is higher than 50% between the ranges of $0 to $19,999 and between $35,000 to $44,999. Especially in this last range, the percentage of successful events is close to the 67% mark. 
-	On the dollar-range of $20,000 to $34,999, the number of failed events is significantly higher (up to 80%) compare to the successful ones.  
-	100% of the events failed in the dollar range of $45,000 to $49,999.
-	There is an 80% probability of failed, for events with goals greater than $50,000.
The results of the "Outcomes based on goals" show that any events from $0 to $4,999 and $35,000 to $44,999 are events with a strong probability of success. Events with goals between dollar-ranges of $25,000 to $34,999 and greater than $45,000 should be re-assed, as they have a really low  chance of being successful (less than 25%).
