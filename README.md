# Analysis of data Kickstarting campaign 

## Overview of project
Louise has been trying to identify trends that will help her implement better practices to determine her targets in a more reliable way. This project presents diverse data related to different crowdfunding campaigns organized by her from 2014 to 2017.  Therefore, through this analysis, Louise will be able to find out any hidden trends. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visualize the campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals. This part of the project will only base our analysis on two categories: Theater and Plays. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes based on Launched date
For the purpose of this analysis, we took into consideration the Parent Category "Theater." To make this evaluation, we considered the number of outcomes (Successful, Failed, Canceled) based on the launched date per month for the campaign (2014 â€“ 2017). 
With the data shown in Chart 1 (see below), Louise will be able to identify the following:
- During May, June, and July, there is a tendency to have many successful events based on her launched dates. The data for these three months also shows that there is a slightly linear behavior of numbers of failed events, which means that the targets established for these three months were coherent.
- The number of successful vs. failed events follows a similar tendency between the months of January to April, and September to November. That means that Louise needs to revaluate her targets for both outcomes. Overall, in order to increase the number of successful events and reduce the number of failed events, she needs to reduce the target goals for the months aforementioned. 
- Another critical point to highlight is that the number of successful and failed events is significantly similar during December, which means that the successful events' goals should be re-assessed for future events during this month.
- Lately, the number of canceled events is insignificant given the population's size shown in the data set and represents a linear behavior along the year. One point to consider is that in October, no events were canceled.
